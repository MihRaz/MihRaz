- Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mihajarisoa from SAYNA. It's a digital school to learn all digital jobs with a good family spirit and game way.
- I'm currently learning to code but I'm not a developper. 
- I'm particularly interested in back-end web development. 
- I expect to learn many things here for what I am aiming to be.
